In physics, chemistry and materials science, percolation refers to the movement and filtering of fluids through porous materials. This repository contains implementation of percolation calculation. A squre grid of choosen size is given as input. All the squares are blocked initially. After that, in each loop, a uniformly selected random square is set open and it goes on until the grid percolates. This implementation calculates the probability of percolation of a given random grid by repeating above mentioned experiment numeruos times.
